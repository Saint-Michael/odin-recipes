I have just completed the basic outline of the recipes project at the end of the HTML section of the coursenand it was enlightening to say the least.
With minor frsutration ive accomplished all of the required tasks and feel much more comfortable using Git and the CLI in general.
On top of that I also feel comfortable writting basic HTML and creating the gernal outline of a website. I've noticed that my typing and ability to read code as also gotten much quicker just in the short amount of time ive been doing this project.
